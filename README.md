TaskPlanner
===========

The Symfony2 Project started on 23rd November 2016. Made using FOSUserBundle, MySQL (Doctrine), and simple bootstrap.

Project includes MySQL database with relations many to many (tasks to categories), many to one (comments to user and task, user to task and comment). 


A logged user can create categories, edit them and is also able to create and edit tasks. The tasks are divided into completed and not completed ones. It is possible to add comments to the tasks (hopefuly soon using AJAX and jQuery). The project includes full registration/login system using FOSUserBundle and twig templates.
