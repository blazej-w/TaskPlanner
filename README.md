TaskPlanner
===========

The Symfony2 Project started on 23rd November 2016. Made using FOSUserBundle, MySQL (Doctrine) and simple bootstrap.

Project includes MySQL database with many to one relations (comments to user and task, user to task and comment, task to categories). 

A logged user can create categories, edit them and is also able to create and edit tasks. The tasks are divided into completed and not completed ones. Each user has his/her own tasks and categories. It is possible to add comments to the tasks (hopefuly soon using AJAX and jQuery). It is not allowed to edit or delete completed tasks. 

The project includes full registration/login system using FOSUserBundle and twig templates.
